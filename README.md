Hi, my name is Shantanu and I am starting with GitHub today, on the 5th day of June month, 2021.

I have lot of interest in data science, inferential statistics and machine learning and I intend to use GitHub to share my machine learning artifacts with others. I will keep adding more resources on topics other than data science and machine learning too. 

Thank you
